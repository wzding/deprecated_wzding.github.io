I am an adaptable Data Scientist skilled in cleaning, interpreting and analyzing data in a fast-paced environment. Highly skilled in machine learning, computer vision, NLP, data visualization, and creative thinking. Currently, I am a Data Scientist at a successful startup, my skills in data science have developed during 4+ years’ experience in my previous role and exposure to projects that heavily involved data analytics, machine learning, statistical computing, and deep learning.

**Email me if you're looking to collaborate on future projects. Always open to new opportunities.**
