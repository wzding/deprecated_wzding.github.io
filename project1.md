Projects in this page are organized by **domain**.

## Transportation
<a href="https://wzding.github.io/wzding.github.io/projects/Vehicle_Detection.html" target="_blank">**Vehicle Detection**</a> - In this project, I create a bounding box for each vehicle detected in a video from a front-facing camera on a car.
<br><br><a href="https://wzding.github.io/wzding.github.io/projects/Object_Detection_MobileNets_SSD.html" target="_blank">**Detecting Cars On The Road**</a> - This .
<br><br><a href="https://wzding.github.io/wzding.github.io/projects/Semantic_Segmentation.html" target="_blank">**Detecting Lane Lines**</a> - I build a pipeline for object detection for autonomous vehicles - detect cars, people, bikes in a image and a video.
<br><br><a href="https://wzding.github.io/wzding.github.io/projects/Wrangle_OpenStreetMap.html" target="_blank">**Wrangle Open Street Map Data**</a> - For this project, I selected San Diego, CA, United States in [Open Street Map](https://www.openstreetmap.org) and used data munging techniques, such as assessing the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity, to clean the OpenStreetMap data. Finally, I used SQL as the data schema to complete the project.

## Aviation
<a href="https://wzding.github.io/wzding.github.io/projects/AirlinesScheduleBlockTimeAdjustmentBehavior.pdf" target="_blank">**A Study on Airlines’ Schedule Block Time Adjustment Behavior**</a> - This study identifies the factors that affect airlines’ schedule block time (the yearly time differences between scheduled departure and arrival times) and quantifies their impacts.
<br><br><a href="https://wzding.github.io/wzding.github.io/projects/LightningstrikeInducedOutages.pdf" target="_blank">**Lightning strike Induced Outages**</a> - This research analyzes lightning strikes and weather conditions, and investigates how lighting-induced outages of airport infrastructure and facilities impact airport performance from an economic perspective.

## Supply Chain Management
<a href="https://wzding.github.io/wzding.github.io/projects/Customer_Segments.html" target="_blank">**Customer Segmentation**</a> - this project is to best describe the variation in the different types of customers that a wholesale distributor interacts with by analyzing customers' annual spending amounts of diverse product categories.
<br><br><a href="https://wzding.github.io/wzding.github.io/projects/stock_out_prediction.html" target="_blank">**Predicting Stock Out**</a> - For this project, I used a variety of different supervised learning approaches (SVMs, KNNs, Decision Trees, Neural Networks), but ultimately found that a Nearest Neighbors	 model got the best accuracy of 99%. I used Numpy and Sklearn to help preprocess the data and create the models.

## Real Estate
<a href="https://wzding.github.io/wzding.github.io/projects/Boston_Housing.html" target="_blank">**Analyzing Boston Housing**</a> - This project make predictions about house in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts by constructing .

## Non-profit
<a href="https://wzding.github.io/wzding.github.io/projects/Finding_Donors_for_Charity.html" target="_blank">**Finding Donors for Charity**</a> - This .

## Learn from Catastrophic Events
<a href="https://wzding.github.io/wzding.github.io/projects/Titanic_Survival_Exploration.html" target="_blank">**Titanic Survival Exploration**</a> - The Kaggle Titanic competition revolved around taking in a dataset of all the passengers in the Titanic, and then predicting whether or not they survived. The features in the dataset included room location, age, gender, etc.
