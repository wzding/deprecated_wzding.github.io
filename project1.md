## Transportation
<a href="https://wzding.github.io/wzding.github.io/projects/Traffic_Light_Detection_and_Classification.html" target="_blank">**Traffic Light Detection and Classification**</a> - created a deep learning model to detect if there is a traffic light in an image as well as determine the color - green, yellow or red - of the light.
<br><br><a href="https://wzding.github.io/wzding.github.io/projects/Vehicle_Detection.html" target="_blank">**Vehicle Detection**</a> - built a pipeline to detect vehicles on the road in a video from a front-facing camera on a car. There was a bounding box for each vehicle detected using this pipeline. 
<br><br><a href="https://wzding.github.io/wzding.github.io/projects/Object_Detection_MobileNets_SSD.html" target="_blank">**Detecting Cars On The Road**</a> - shared a similar goal with the project above, detecting cars, people, bikes in a image, but it approached this goal with a totally different method.
<br><br><a href="https://wzding.github.io/wzding.github.io/projects/Advanced-Lane-Finding.html" target="_blank">**Detecting Lane Lines on A Highway**</a> - detected lane lines on a highway as well as calculated curvature and vehicle's position in a video. 
<br><br><a href="https://wzding.github.io/wzding.github.io/projects/Semantic_Segmentation.html" target="_blank">**Detecting Lane Lines**</a> - used an advance method for pixel-wise detection of the road in a series of images. 
<br><br><a href="" target="_blank">**Train a Smartcab to Drive**</a> - applied reinforcement learning techniques for a self-driving agent in a simplified world to assist it in effectively reaching its destinations in allotted time.
<br><br><a href="https://wzding.github.io/wzding.github.io/projects/Wrangle_OpenStreetMap.html" target="_blank">**Wrangle Open Street Map Data**</a> - For this project, I selected San Diego, CA, United States in [Open Street Map](https://www.openstreetmap.org) and used data munging techniques, such as assessing the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity, to clean the raw data. I used SQL as the data schema to complete the project.

----
## Aviation
<a href="https://wzding.github.io/wzding.github.io/projects/AirlinesScheduleBlockTimeAdjustmentBehavior.pdf" target="_blank">**A Study on Airlines’ Schedule Block Time Adjustment Behavior**</a> - identified several factors that affect airlines’ schedule block time (the yearly time differences of scheduled departure times and arrival times) and quantified their impacts.
<br><br><a href="https://wzding.github.io/wzding.github.io/projects/LightningstrikeInducedOutages.pdf" target="_blank">**Lightning strike Induced Outages**</a> - This research analyzed lightning strikes and weather conditions, and investigated how lighting-induced outages of airport infrastructure and facilities impact airport performance from an economic perspective.

----
## Supply Chain Management
<a href="https://wzding.github.io/wzding.github.io/projects/Customer_Segments.html" target="_blank">**Customer Segmentation**</a> - this project aimed at describing the variation in different types of customers that a wholesale distributor interacts with by analyzing customers' annual spending amounts on diverse product categories.
<br><br><a href="https://wzding.github.io/wzding.github.io/projects/stock_out_prediction.html" target="_blank">**Predicting Stock Out**</a> - used a variety of approaches to predict stock out of a certain product for a company and achieved over 90% accuracy.

----
## Real Estate
<a href="https://wzding.github.io/wzding.github.io/projects/Boston_Housing.html" target="_blank">**Analyzing Boston Housing**</a> - predicted house prices in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts by leveraging the data of existing houses, such as the average number of rooms among homes in the neighborhood, the percentage of homeowners in the neighborhood considered "lower class" (working poor) and the ratio of students to teachers in primary and secondary schools in the neighborhood.

----
## Entertainment
<a href="https://wzding.github.io/wzding.github.io/projects/Dog_Identification_App.html" target="_blank">**Developing A Dog Identification App**</a> - aimed at developing an algorithm that accept any user-supplied image as input and predict the most relevant dog breed of that image. If a dog is detected in the image, it provides an estimate of the dog's breed. If a human is detected, it provides an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling.
<br><br><a href="https://wzding.github.io/wzding.github.io/projects/Select_Genre_of_Next_Movie.html" target="_blank">**Select Genre of Next Movie**</a> - made recommendations on the genre of a studio’s next movie using the dataset of IMDB movie ratings. I came up with two metrics to evaluate the popularity and reputation of a movie of a cerain genre which helps us in data-driven decision making.

----
## Non-profit
<a href="https://wzding.github.io/wzding.github.io/projects/Finding_Donors_for_Charity.html" target="_blank">**Finding Donors for Charity**</a> - built algorithms to identify individuals who are most likely to donate among 45k potential donors for a non-profit organization to reduce overhead cost of sending mails and outreach.

----
## Learn from Disaster
<a href="https://wzding.github.io/wzding.github.io/projects/Titanic_Survival_Exploration.html" target="_blank">**Titanic Survival Exploration**</a> - The project revolved around taking in a dataset of all the passengers in the Titanic disaster, which includes data such as age, gender, ticket price and etc. to predict whether or not they survived.
