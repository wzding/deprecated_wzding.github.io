Projects in this page are organized by **technology**.

## Supervised Learning
### Classification
<a href="https://wzding.github.io/wzding.github.io/projects/Finding_Donors_for_Charity.html" target="_blank">**Finding Donors for Charity**</a> - In this project, we build algorithms to identify potential donors for a non-profit organization to reduce overhead cost of sending mails.
<br><br><a href="https://wzding.github.io/wzding.github.io/projects/stock_out_prediction.html" target="_blank">**Predicting Stock Out**</a> - For this project, I used a variety of different supervised learning approaches (SVMs, KNNs, Decision Trees, Neural Networks) to predict stock out for a company, and ultimately found that a Nearest Neighbors model got the best accuracy of 99%. I used Numpy and Sklearn to help preprocess the data and create the models.
<br><br><a href="https://wzding.github.io/wzding.github.io/projects/Titanic_Survival_Exploration.html" target="_blank">**Titanic Survival Exploration**</a> - The project revolved around taking in a dataset of all the passengers in the Titanic disaster, which includes data such as age, gender, ticket price and etc. to predict whether or not they survived. 

### Regression
<a href="https://wzding.github.io/wzding.github.io/projects/Boston_Housing.html" target="_blank">**Analyzing Boston Housing**</a> - This project makes predictions about house price in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts by leveraging the data of a house, such as the average number of rooms among homes in the neighborhood, the percentage of homeowners in the neighborhood considered "lower class" (working poor) and the ratio of students to teachers in primary and secondary schools in the neighborhood.
<br><br><a href="https://wzding.github.io/wzding.github.io/projects/LightningstrikeInducedOutages.pdf" target="_blank">**Lightning strike Induced Outages**</a> - This research analyzes lightning strikes and weather conditions, and investigates how lighting-induced outages of airport infrastructure and facilities impact airport performance from an economic perspective.

## Unsupervised Learning
### Clustering
<a href="https://wzding.github.io/wzding.github.io/projects/Customer_Segments.html" target="_blank">**Customer Segmentation**</a> - this project is to best describe the variation in different types of customers that a wholesale distributor interacts with by analyzing customers' annual spending amounts on diverse product categories.
### Recommendation
<a href="https://wzding.github.io/wzding.github.io/projects/Select_Genre_of_Next_Movie.html" target="_blank">**Select Genre of Next Movie**</a> - In this project, our goal is to pick the genre of our studio’s next movie using the dataset of IMDB movie ratings. We come up with two metrics to evaluate the popularity and reputation of a movie in a cerain genre and make recommendations on the genre of our next movie.

## Reinforcement Learning
<a href="" target="_blank">**Train a Smartcab to Drive**</a> - In this project, we apply reinforcement learning techniques for a self-driving agent in a simplified world to aid it in effectively reaching its destinations in the allotted time.

## Computer Vision
<a href="https://wzding.github.io/wzding.github.io/projects/Dog_Identification_App.html" target="_blank">**Developing A Dog Identification App**</a> - This project aims at developing an algorithm that could accept any user-supplied image as input. If a dog is detected in the image, it will provide an estimate of the dog's breed. If a human is detected, it will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling.
<br><br><a href="https://wzding.github.io/wzding.github.io/projects/Vehicle_Detection.html" target="_blank">**Vehicle Detection**</a> - In this project, I create a pipeline to detect vehicles on the road in a video from a front-facing camera on a car - there is a bounding box for each vehicle detected. 
<br><br><a href="https://wzding.github.io/wzding.github.io/projects/Object_Detection_MobileNets_SSD.html" target="_blank">**Detecting Cars On The Road**</a> - This project shares similar goal with the one above, detecting cars, people, bikes in a image, but it approaches the goal with a totally different method.
<br><br><a href="https://wzding.github.io/wzding.github.io/projects/Semantic_Segmentation.html" target="_blank">**Detecting Lane Lines**</a> - In this project, we use semantic segmentation to assign each pixel to the road in a series of images.

## NLP


## Database
<a href="https://wzding.github.io/wzding.github.io/projects/Wrangle_OpenStreetMap.html" target="_blank">**Wrangle Open Street Map Data**</a> - For this project, I selected San Diego, CA, United States in [Open Street Map](https://www.openstreetmap.org) and used data munging techniques, such as assessing the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity, to clean the raw data. I used SQL as the data schema to complete the project.

## Behavior Modeling
<a href="https://wzding.github.io/wzding.github.io/projects/AirlinesScheduleBlockTimeAdjustmentBehavior.pdf" target="_blank">**A Study on Airlines’ Schedule Block Time Adjustment Behavior**</a> - This study identifies the factors that affect airlines’ schedule block time (the yearly time differences of scheduled departure times and arrival times) and quantifies their impacts.

## Tools I use
* Language: Python, C++
* Database: MySQL, MongoDB
* Data Analysis: pandas, numpy, sklearn
